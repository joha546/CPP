/*
This operator is used to decrement the value by 1. There are two types of decrement operators.

Post-decrement operator: Post decrement operator is used to decrement the value of the variable after it has been 
evaluated for use in the expression.
Pre-decrement operator: Pre decrement operator is used to decrement the value of the variable before itâ€™s evaluated 
in the expression.
