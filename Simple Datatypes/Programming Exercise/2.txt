 Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and your weight
 in pounds. (Use three variables to store the information.) Have the program report
 your body mass index (BMI).To calculate the BMI, first convert your height in feet
 and inches to your height in inches (1 foot = 12 inches).Then convert your height
 in inches to your height in meters by multiplying by 0.0254.Then convert your
 weight in pounds into your mass in kilograms by dividing by 2.2. Finally,compute
 your BMI by dividing your mass in kilograms by the square of your height in
 meters. Use symbolic constants to represent the various conversion factors.
