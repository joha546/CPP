/*
Overflow occurs when we assign a value to more than its range, and Underflow is the opposite of the 
overflow. In the case of overflow and underflow, the C++ compiler doesnâ€™t throw any errors. It simply
 changes the value. 

The minimum value of int data type is -2,147,483,648  (INT_MIN) and after decrementing 1 on this 
value, it will return 2,147,483,647 (INT_MAX). This is known as underflow.
